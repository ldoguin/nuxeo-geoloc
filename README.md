nuxeo-geoloc
============

Add geographical location to Nuxeo documents. Every documents will have geo location tab displaying a button to add the GeoLocation facet. Once the facet is added it displays a map. User can point anywhere in the map and save the coordinates as doc properties.

There is also a 'Map' link in the user menu pointing to a map and displaying a pointer for every geolocated document. When the user click on the pointer he gets a small popup with the doc title and a link to it.

TODO
====

Here are some ideas:
- show more information on the pointer popup (thumnail, desc...)
- use the cover metadata to filter pointers on the map
- add tags for pointers..
